** Invalid function call without declaration:
 In this test case, we define a function foo that takes two parameters x and y.
 We then define another function bar that calls foo before its definition. Since foo is not defined before bar,
 a declaration is required. Since there is no declaration, this code should produce an error. **

<<<driver program>>>
start
end

<<module bar>> takes input [x: integer, y: real];
start
  for (i in 1..20)
    start
        use module foo with parameters x, y;
    end
end

<<module foo>>
takes input [x: integer, y: real];
returns [z: boolean];
start
end
